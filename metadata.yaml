description: "Jack Tier, or the Florida Reef is a novel by James Fenimore Cooper first\
  \ published in 1848 by New York publisher Hurd and Houghton. Set during the Mexican-American\
  \ war, the novel relates a twenty-year homosocial relationship verging on the homoerotic\
  \ between a sailor and the captain of the boat. But by the end of the novel the\
  \ sailor is the captain's wife, transforming the story into a story of heterosexual\
  \ love and passion.\nThe novel was first published serially in a magazine under\
  \ the title Rose Budd in 1846. When commenting on the novel in the context of other\
  \ novels about the Mexican-American War, critic Jaime Javier Rodr√≠guez describes\
  \ the novel as \"an obscure work not always found in library stacks [thus it] remains\
  \ largely unread but it too deserves attention.\"\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
